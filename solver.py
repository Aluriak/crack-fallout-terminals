"""Module that implement the solving routines for the Fallout terminal puzzle.

Puzzle is:
Words (at least 5, no more than 100) are given.
One of them is the 'key'.
Player win if it gives the key before the 5-th try (therefore, 4 words can be tested).

If player gives a word that is not the key,
he gain knowledge about how many letters are placed at the same place.
(see compute_score for exact definition)
